## Hi there 👋

❤️ My interests are web design and programming. 
🔨 Skills: CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and Inkscape.  
🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and English.  
📁 Almost all projects are in the [homepage repository](https://github.com/irvirty/irvirty.pages.dev).  
⚡ Fun fact: Using CSS you can draw something, this is called CSS Art.
