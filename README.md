## Hi there 👋

👨🏻‍💻 I'm a self-taught web developer.  
❤️ My interests are web design and programming.  
🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and English.  
🔨 Skills: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and Inkscape.  
📁 Almost all projects are in one [repository](https://github.com/irvirty/irvirty.pages.dev) or [website](https://irvirty.pages.dev/).  
⚡ Fun fact: Using CSS you can draw something, this is called CSS Art.
