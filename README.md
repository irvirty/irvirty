## Hi there 👋

- ❤️ My interests are web design and programming.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on test projects for practice.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and English.
- 📁 Almost all projects are in the [homepage repository](https://github.com/irvirty/irvirty.pages.dev). It's more convenient for me to post and update this way, although it's inconvenient for you if you only need 1 project, sorry.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Using CSS you can draw something, this is called CSS Art.
