## Hey There!
â€¢ I use HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript (self-taught).  
â€¢ I'm currently learning JS (JavaScript) and English.  
â€¢ How to reach me: [irvirty@gmail.com](mailto:irvirty@gmail.com)  
â€¢ Fun fact:  
â€¢ README.md functions similarly to the main page (index.html) in a repository.  
â€¢ Using CSS you can draw something, this is called CSS Art.
